# Visualizing-Word-Frequency-In-Julius-Caesar
In this prohject we are going to find answer of 
<b>What are the most frequent words in Julius Caesar by Shakespeare , and how often do they occur?</b>

* In this notebook, we'll scrape the novel <em>Julius Caesar</em> from the website <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package <code>requests</code>. 
* Then we'll extract words from this web data using <code>BeautifulSoup</code>.
*  Next, we'll dive into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (<code>nltk</code>) and <code>Counter</code>.
*  Finally, we'll start data visualization technique where words from a given text are displayed in a chart, with the more important words being written with bigger, bold fonts, while less important words are displayed with smaller, thinner fonts, using <code>wordcloud</code>,<code>matplotlib.pylot</code> and <code>PIL</code>
*  The <em>Data Science pipeline</em> we'll build in this notebook can be used to visualize the word frequency distributions of any novel that you can find on Project Gutenberg.
*  The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text. 
*  Text data has grown exponentially in recent years resulting in an ever-increasing need to analyze the massive amounts of such data. 
*  Word Cloud provides an excellent option to analyze the text data through visualization in the form of tags, or words, where the importance of a word is explained by its frequency.
